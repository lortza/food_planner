Ingredients:
	1/4 cup uncooked rice (which you will need to cook separately)
	1 small white onion
	1 medium carrot
	1/4 cup celery
	2/3 cup zucchini
	1 cup chayote
	1 red bell pepper
	1 anaheim pepper
	1 cup chopped fresh kale (not packed)
	1 teaspoon garlic salt (or sea salt)
	2 cubes Edwards & Sons Red Curry (chopped up)

Instructions:
	Cook the rice and set it aside (general rule, 2.5 water : 1 rice. Boil water, add rice, bring to boil, simmer low for 30-40 min.).
	Chop dice all of the vegetables (except the kale) and put them in a big soup pot.
	Add a little EVOO and cook, stirring frequently, on medium heat. Cover. Stir every few minutes, making sure you have enough steam to cook without burning to the bottom.
	In a separate pot, boil 2 cups of water and dissolve the curry cubes.
	When the vegetables are almost soft, add the rice and curry water to the big pot.
	Simmer on low for 10 minutes.
	Serve with a hearty rye or your favorite artisan bread

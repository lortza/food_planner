Ingredients:
[Spiced Tofu]
	2 teaspoons oil
	half of a 14 oz firm tofu block (I use Nasoya firm tofu. 1.5-2 cups cubed tofu) lightly pressed to remove excess moisture
	1/4 tsp salt or to taste
	1/2 tsp cumin powder
	1/2 tsp garam masala
	1/2 tsp garlic powder
	a generous pinch of kala namak (optional)
	1/2 tsp cayenne(to taste)

[Spinach curry]
	2 cups packed Spinach, washed, chopped if large
	1/4 cup water
	1/4 cup almond milk or coconut milk
	2 Tablespoons soaked cashews, soaked for 15 minutes or use ground raw cashew (less or more for creamy consistency to preference)
	4 cloves of garlic
	an inch cube of ginger
	1 Serano chili pepper or to taste
	1 medium tomato chopped
	1/4 to 1/2 tsp salt to taste
	1 teaspoon raw sugar or maple syrup
	1/4 teaspoon garam masala
	cashew cream, pepper flakes to garnish

Instructions:
	In a pan, add oil and heat on medium heat. Chop up the tofu and add to the oil. Mix to coat and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add all the spices under Spiced Tofu and mix to coat. Add 2 tsp nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor if you like. Continue to cook for 8-10 minutes, partially covered on low-medium heat. See video above
	Meanwhile, wash the spinach and add it and all the other ingredients under Spinach curry except garam masala to the blender. Blend into a smooth puree. Add the puree to the sizzling tofu. Mix well. Add garam masala to taste. Cook covered on low-medium heat for 10-15 minutes or until the raw garlic smell is not detectable and desired gravy consistency is achieved. Taste and adjust salt and spice.
	Drizzle some cashew cream and Serve hot with Naan, roti or other flat breads, or with quinoa or rice. Add pepper flakes for added heat. Sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon powder for variation.

Ingredients:
	1 large, ripe avocado (it should be soft)
	2 cups plain yogurt of choice (such as Wholesoy) (440g)
	1/2 cup milk of choice (120g)
	1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract (2g)
	1/8 teaspoon salt
	pinch pure stevia extract, or 3-4 tbsp sugar of choice (Amount will depend on the sweetness of your yogurt, and you may need more if you’re using an unsweetened yogurt. You want the non-frozen mixture to taste a little too sweet for your liking, as it is less sweet once frozen.)

Instructions:
	Scrape out the flesh of the avocado and discard the peel and pit. Blend all ingredients until completely smooth, in a blender, food processor, or Vita-Mix. If you have an ice cream maker, transfer mixture to the machine and churn according to manufacturer’s directions. My Cuisinart took just 10 minutes. Eat immediately as soft-serve, or freeze in an airtight container for a half hour if you want a firmer texture. (If you don’t have an ice cream machine, you can simply transfer the blended mixture to an airtight container, freeze, and stir every half hour for 2-3 hours. The texture won’t be quite as creamy, but it still works.)

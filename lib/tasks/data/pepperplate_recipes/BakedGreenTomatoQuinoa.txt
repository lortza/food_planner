Ingredients:
	1 tomato (green), large dice
	1 tomato (red), large dice
	1 red bell pepper, diced
	3 cloves of garlic, chopped
	1/2 medium onion, chopped
	1/2 cup uncooked quinoa
	1 cup vegetable broth
	1/8 cup cheddar cheese, cubed or shredded (optional)

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 400F.
	Roast the quinoa in a dry skillet until it starts to brown.
	Add the broth to the quinoa and cook as directed (usually, bring to a boil, then set to low for 30 min).
	Place the green tomato, onion, and garlic in another skillet with a little olive oil and cook on medium-low until the tomatoes soften and the onions are translucent.
	When the quinoa and tomato/onion mixture are ready, mix them both together and add in the red tomato, red pepper, and cheese.
	Transfer to a casserole dish and place in the oven for about 20-30 minutes.

Ingredients:
	1 cup of red lentils
	1 head of cauliflower
	1 small zucchini
	1 medium onion
	2 Edwards & Sons Red Curry cubes <– the pre-packaged culprit
	a few sprigs of fresh cilantro

Instructions:
	Pick through your lentils to make sure there are no rocks or foreign objects.
	Boil 2 cups of water in a medium sauce pan and then add the lentils. Boil of a few minutes, then cover and simmer until they’re tender.
	In the meantime, tackle that cauliflower. Chop it into bite-size bit and toss it into a big soup pot.
	Chop the onion and zucchini, and toss into the pot.
	Stir, cover, and turn the heat on to medium high. Keep an eye on this, you’ll want to stir these guys and make sure they’re cooking well without burning onto the bottom. You may need to add a splash of water every now and then to keep the steam going.
	When the lentils are tender, toss the cubes with them and stir until they’re dissolved. It helps if you break them up a bit first. They really don’t like to dissolve quickly.
	Once the curry cubes are dissolved and the cauliflower pierces nicely with a fork, pour the whole lentil mess in to the pot with the cauliflower.
	Stir, cover, and let this simmer a little to get all curried up together for 5 minutes. Mmmm.
	Serve with rice and fresh naan and top with fresh cilantro leaves. Don’t have naan? (I mean, who does?) If you have a brand of flour tortilla that you really love, you can warm one in a skillet to serve with the dahl.

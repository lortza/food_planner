Ingredients:
	1 to 1 1/4 lb. sweet potato $0.78
	4 cups water $0.00
	1 teaspoon salt $0.05
	1 cup uncooked yellow grits $0.27
	1 cup milk $0.25
	2 Tbsp butter $0.24
	1/4 teaspoon cinnamon $0.02
	1/8 teaspoon nutmeg $0.02

Instructions:
	Rinse the sweet potato to remove any dirt and then prick with a fork. Loosely wrap the sweet potato in a paper towel, place on a microwave safe plate, and then microwave for 5 minutes on high. Squeeze the sweet potato to see if it is soft all the way through, and microwave for a few minutes longer if it isn’t. Allow the sweet potato to cool slightly, and then scoop out the cooked flesh.
	Cook the grits according to the package directions. (Add four cups of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium sauce pot and bring to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour in the uncooked grits. Stir the mixture until it comes back up to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting, place a lid on top, and let simmer for ten minutes.)
	Meanwhile, add the cooked sweet potato flesh to a blender and add just enough milk to allow the sweet potato to blend into a puree. I used about one cup of milk. It’s okay if there are a few sweet potato chunks.
	After the grits have cooked, remove the lid and give them a good stir to help them finish absorbing the water. Add the sweet potatoes and stir until well mixed. Next add the butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir again until smooth. Taste and adjust salt, butter, or other seasonings to your liking. Serve hot.

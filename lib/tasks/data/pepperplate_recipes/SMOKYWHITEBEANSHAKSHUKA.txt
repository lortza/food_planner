Ingredients:
	2 Tbsp olive oil
	4 cloves garlic
	1 yellow onion
	28 oz. can whole peeled tomatoes
	1/2 Tbsp smoked paprika
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
	1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
	Freshly cracked pepper
	1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
	15 oz. can cannellini beans or lentils
	4 large eggs
	Handful fresh parsley, chopped
	2 oz. feta, crumbled

Instructions:
	Mince the garlic and finely dice the onion. Cook both in a large deep skillet with olive oil over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about 5 minutes).
	Add the canned tomatoes and their juices, crushing the tomatoes with your hands as you add them to the skillet. Add the smoked paprika, cumin, oregano, red pepper flakes, and some freshly cracked pepper as well. Stir to combine.
	Allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Let the sauce simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5-7 minutes, or until it has thickened slightly. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, then taste the sauce and adjust the salt or other spices to your liking.
	Drain the white beans, add them to the skillet, then stir to combine. Allow the skillet to return to a simmer. Simmer for 2-3 minutes more.
	Crack four eggs into the skillet, then place a lid on top and let them simmer for 5 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still soft. Top the skillet with the crumbled feta and chopped parsley.

Ingredients:
	3/4 cup uncooked jasmine rice (plus 1 cup water)
	1/2 block tofu, squeezed & crumbled (or 2 eggs, scrambled and cooked with a dash of salt)
	1 1/2 cups cubed fresh pineapple
	1 teaspoon finely chopped jalapeno
	1 large red bell pepper, diced (about 3/4 cup diced)
	1/2 bunch green onions, green and white parts, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)
	2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
	1/2 cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews
	1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
	1 to 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce or sriracha
	1 juice of lime
	1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped

Instructions:
[Egg Option]
	If you want to use eggs in place of tofu, scramble and cook some eggs and set them aside.

[Regular Preparation]
	In the larger sauce pan, get the rice started
	Prep your veg and tofu while the rice is cooking. When the rice is done, start cooking in the soup pot.
	Put some oil in the soup pot on medium high high  (pretty hot)
	Cook the cashews, pineapple, and red pepper and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has almost evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.
	Then add the green onion and garlic. Cook, while stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds or longer.
	Add the crumbled tofu and cook until it is warm and pretty well mixed into the flavors.
	Add the rice to the pot and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot, about 3 minutes.
	Turn off the heat.
	Add 1 tablespoon tamari (or soy sauce) and chili garlic sauce or sriracha, to taste.
	Add lime juice and salt
	Stir in cilantro

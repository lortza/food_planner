Title: Pho
Description: Make the broth ahead of time and keep it in the freezer. It takes a long time and once the broth is done, making the soup is super fast.

Ingredients:
[Broth]
	4 large shallots, cut in half lengthwise
	2 large thumb size pieces of ginger, cut in half lengthwise
	6 carrots, roughly cut into chunks
	2 stalks of lemongrass, tops and bottoms trimmed off and sliced into 1/2" pieces
	1 whole bulb of garlic, peeled and smashed
	3 whole star anise
	2 cinnamon sticks
	1 teaspoon peppercorns
	2 small limes, juiced
	1/4 cup reduced sodium tamari or soy sauce to taste (You may want more or less.)
	10 cups of water

[Fixins]
	3/4 to 1 lb wide rice noodles
	1 lime, in wedges
	1 handfull of mung bean sprouts
	1 bottle reduced sodium tamari
	1 bottle sriracha or chili garlic paste
	1 minced jalapeno or serrano pepper
	1 baby bok choi or sliced cabbage, blanched in boiling water for 30 seconds
	1 small handful of cilantro
	1 handful of basil (thai basil if you can find it!)
	1 handful of mint
	2 shredded carrots
	1 bunch green onions, sliced
	1 red onion or shallots, thinly sliced
	1 block tofu, cubed & baked

Instructions:
	I'm not kidding when I say that the herbs (cilantro, basil and mint) are NOT optional! Neither is the lime juice. Those just make this soup what it is. Beyond that, feel free to use what you like and leave out what you don't. Adding every one of these things will result in a super amazing soup that is very refreshing and satisfying!
	Boil the noodles in water until they are cooked according to the package directions. Drain them and add them to each bowl. Ladle some soup broth on top.

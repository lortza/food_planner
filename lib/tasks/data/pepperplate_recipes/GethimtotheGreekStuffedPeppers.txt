Ingredients:
	1 cup raw millet/quinoa/couscous
	1 cup low/no sodium veggie stock
	2 red bell peppers, halved, de-seeded, pre-roasted
	1/4 finely chopped green bell pepper (optional)
	1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic
	1/4 teaspoon onion powder
	1 Tbsp dried oregano
	1/4 teaspoon black pepper
	1 can black eyed peas, rinsed + drained
	1/4 cup halved kalamata olives, pitted
	1/4 cup chopped sun-dried tomatoes
	6 handfuls baby spinach, chopped
	4 oz feta cheese
	2 Tbs toasted pine nuts

Instructions:
	Heat a pot with a swirl of oil over medium.
	Rinse + drain the millet then add to the pot and toast [stirring]
	for 3-4 minutes.
	Add the veggie stock and water and bring to a boil.
	Stir once then reduce heat to simmer and cover for 20min. Do not stir during this time.
	Be sure the liquid has absorbed [tip the pan to check]
	then remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes, keeping covered. Fluff with a fork.
	Preheat your oven to broil and lightly oil, salt, and pepper the halved peppers and place on a baking sheet.
	Just as you remove the millet from the burner, heat a large pan over medium and add 2-3 teaspoons of olive oil.
	Once hot, add the onion and stir occasionally until translucent and soft. About 5-8 minutes.
	Stir in the garlic, oregano, and black pepper for 30 seconds until fragrant, then add in the chickpeas and cook for about 6-8 minutes until starting to brown.
	While cooking, place peppers under the broiler for a 2-4 minutes, then flip and broil for another 2-4 minutes. You want them slightly tender, not limp. Set aside.
	To your pan add the olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and 2 cups of fluffed millet and stir together.
	Add in your spinach and incorporate until just starting to wilt, another 3-4 minutes.
	Add half the feta, lemon juice, and lemon zest, then give it one more stir and taste. Add more salt if desired. The olives, sun-dried tomatoes, and cheese have a hefty amount of sodium so taste and add as desired.
	Lightly pack into peppers, top with remaining feta, and place under the broiler until the mixture starts to brown. About 2-3 minutes.

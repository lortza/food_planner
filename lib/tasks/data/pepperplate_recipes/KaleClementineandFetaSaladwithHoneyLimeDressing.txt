Ingredients:
[Salad]
	1 bunch kale
	1 avocado, diced
	1 medium pomegranate, arils removed, or a handful of dried cranberries
	4 clementines, peeled and sliced into rounds or small strips
	4 small radishes, sliced into thin rounds and then into skinny strips
	Handful fresh cilantro, chopped
	1/3 cup crumbled feta
	1/4 cup pepitas (AKA pumpkin seeds) or sunflower seeds

[Dressing]
	3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (about 2 small limes)
	3 tablespoons olive oil
	1 medium jalape√±o, membranes and seeds removed, finely chopped
	2 teaspoons honey (or agave nectar)
	1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
	1/4 teaspoon chili powder
	1/8 teaspoon fine grain sea salt

Instructions:
	First, make the dressing by whisking together all of the ingredients in a small bowl.
	Prepare the kale by slicing out the stems and chopping out the leaves into small, bite-sized pieces. Transfer the kale to a big salad bowl. Sprinkle a small pinch of sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time, until the leaves are darker in color and fragrant.
	Drizzle salad dressing over the kale (you might not need all of the dressing) and toss well so the kale is lightly coated with dressing. Add the prepared avocado, pomegranate (or dried cranberries), clementines, radishes, cilantro and feta to the bowl.
	Toast the pepitas in a skillet over medium-low heat for a few minutes, stirring frequently, until they smell fragrant and toasty. Transfer the pepitas to the salad bowl. Toss the salad to combine and serve.

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

[The Filling]
	Cut the zucchini & yellow squash into thin 1/4 moon slices.
	Rinse and drain the beans.
	Slice the green onions (both green and white portions).
	Chop the cilantro.
	Combine the zucchini, black beans, frozen corn kernels, green onions, cilantro, and diced green chiles in a bowl.
	Add 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir until evenly combined.

[Assemble the Lasagne]
	Spray the 9x13 glass casserole dish generously with olive oil spray.
	Spread a 1/2 cup of the sauce in the bottom of the dish.
	Arrange 1/3 of the tortillas over the sauce (I like to do a whole one, then tear one in half and put the straight edges on the edge of the pan. Then alternate this pattern with each new layer).
	Cover with 1/3 of the vegetable mixture.
	Drizzle 1/2 cup of the sauce over the vegetables, then top with 1/2 cup cheese.
	Repeat these layers two more times, or until the vegetable mix, sauce, and cheese are gone.
	Bake the casserole for 30-45 minutes, or until the edges are bubbly and the cheese just begins to brown on top.
	Slice into six portions

Ingredients:
	3 to 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
	1 onion, chopped
	1 carrot, finely diced
	1 celery stick, finely diced
	few thyme sprigs
	2 bay leaves
	2 garlic clove, finely chopped
	7 oz chorizo, diced
	1/4 tsp cinnamon
	1 tsp hot smoked paprika
	2 x 14oz cans chickpeas, rinsed and drained <-- use lentils
	1 to 2 tbsp sherry vinegar
	14 oz bag spinach <-- use frozen kale
	leaves, washed and drained

Instructions:
	Heat the oil in a large pan, then gently fry the onion for 3-4 mins until it begins to soften. Stir in the carrot, celery, thyme and bay leaves. Season, then cook for 2-3 mins, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, chorizo, cinnamon and smoked paprika. Gently fry until the vegetables soften and the chorizo starts to release its oils and crisp up.
	Stir in the chickpeas, vinegar and 0.6 cups (150ml) water, then bring to a simmer for 1-2 mins until the chickpeas have heated up. Add the spinach, then stir through the chickpeas until it wilts a little. Remove from the heat, season to taste, then serve warm with crusty bread.

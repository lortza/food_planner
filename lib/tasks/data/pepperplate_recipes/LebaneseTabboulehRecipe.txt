Ingredients:
	1/2 cup fine bulgur
	1 cup boiling-hot water
	1 small garlic clove, minced (optional)
	Juice of 2 large lemons, to taste
	1 bunch chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
	1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
	2 medium ripe tomatoes, very finely chopped
	1 bunch scallions, finely chopped <-- optional
	3 tablespoons olive oil
	bed of salad greens
	1/2 cucumber, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/4-inch pieces
	3/4 teaspoon salt
	1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:
	Place the bulgur in a bowl and pour in boiling water.
	Soak for 20 minutes, until slightly softened.
	Drain using the small strainer, and through a cheesecloth-lined strainer, and press the bulgur against the strainer to squeeze out excess water.
	Transfer to a large bowl, and toss with the garlic, lemon juice, parsley, mint, tomatoes, scallions and salt.
	Leave at room temperature or in the refrigerator for two to three hours, so that the bulgur can continue to absorb liquid and swell.
	Add the olive oil, toss together, taste and adjust seasonings.
	Serve on a bed of lettuce

Notes: Advance preparation: This will keep for a day in the refrigerator, though the bright green color will fade because of the lemon juice. Martha Rose Shulman can be reached at martha-rose-shulman.com.

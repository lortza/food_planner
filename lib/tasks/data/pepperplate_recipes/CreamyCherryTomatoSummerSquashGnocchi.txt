Ingredients:
	16 oz package of gnocchi (or 1/2 lb penne pasta)
	1 pint (2 cups) cherry tomatoes
	2 medium yellow squash, quartered vertically and then sliced into 1/4-inch wide wedges
	1 medium zucchini, quartered vertically and then sliced into 1/4-inch wide wedges
	Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	2 tablespoons lemon juice (the juice of 1 lemon)
	2 tablespoons olive oil
	1 ounce goat cheese, crumbled
	1 small clove garlic
	1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
	8 leaves fresh basil, chopped
	1 teaspoon of dried oregano

Instructions:
[When Preparing in Advance]
	Divide all of the veg into 2 containers.
	Cook the gnocchi when you plan to eat it, not in advance
	Use 8oz of a 16oz package for each 2-person meal

[General Prep Notes]
	Preheat oven to 400F
	Slice the squashes and zucchini into half moons that are about 1/8" thick
	Lube up the baking tray
	Place the squashes and zucchini and whole cherry tomatoes on the baking tray in a single layer
	Sprinkle with salt and pepper
	Roast for about 25 minutes, stirring to keep from sticking
	It's done when the cherry tomatoes have burst and the squash is tender.
	Cook the pasta (Use the large soup pot because we're going to put the pasta back in it) NOTE: Don't drain the pasta without consulting the next step.
	Set aside about a cup of pasta water when you strain the pasta.
	Add 2 TBSP oil to the bottom of the soup pot then put the pasta back in and stir.
	Immediately add the goat cheese, garlic, and red pepper flakes
	Put the small mesh strainer over the pot and juice the lemon into the mix. (you may have to put one end of the strainer on the pot and the other on a wooden spoon across the pot)
	Add about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water and gently toss the pasta until the ingredients are evenly mixed together and the pasta is coated in a light sauce (add more reserved cooking water if the pasta seems dry).
	Once the tomatoes and squash are done, pour the whole thing into the pot, jusices and all
	Season to taste with salt and pepper
	Stir in the basil and oregano

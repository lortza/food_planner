Ingredients:
	Ingredients:
	1/2 cup cacao powder
	1/4 cup coconut oil
	1/4 cup pure maple syrup
	1/4 cup all natural, organic peanut butter* (or almond butter or cashew butter)
	12 mini cupcake wrappers
	Note: I like to use the peanut butter you can press fresh from a container so it’s in its most natural state. If you can’t find that, then look for an organic, all-natural brand. Certain brands you find on the shelf have added toxins and chemicals that are not good for our bodies.

Instructions:
	Directions:
	) Mix cacao powder, coconut oil, and maple syrup in a small bowl until a smooth consistency is formed.
	) Place a small spoonful of the chocolate into the bottom of the cupcake wrappers.
	) Add a small scoop of peanut butter to the chocolate and spread evenly.
	) Top the peanut butter with a small scoop of the chocolate and spread evenly to coat the surface.
	) Place the mini Peanut Butter Cups in the freezer.
	) Serve once they are hardened and chilled (about 1 hour).
	) If you are storing them to eat later, store in the freezer.

Ingredients:
	3 Tbsp vegetable oil
	2 cups chopped onions
	2 cloves garlic, minced
	2 small carrots, sliced
	2 cups thinly sliced cabbage
	1 cup cut green beans
	2 green peppers, chopped
	1 small zucchini, cut in half lengthwise and sliced in half-moons
	2 cups sliced mushrooms
	2 large tomatoes, chopped
	2 Tbsp tamari soy sauce
	2 Tbsp paprika
	1/4 tsp dried marjoram
	1 Tbsp dried dill
	6 cups vegetable stock or water
	6 oz tomato paste
	1/2 cup dry red wine
	Salt to taste

Instructions:
	Put some olive oil in the bottom of your big old soup pot and get ready to start chopping. There is a lot of help, so a friend, or a food processor friend is really nice. Start with your onions & garlic, and put them in the pot on medium heat. Give them a stir while youâ€™re chopping your cabbage. Once the onions are translucent, add the cabbage to the pot. Stir frequently while chopping your carrots, green beans, bell peppers, and zucchini. Once the cabbage has started to soften, toss the newly chopped veg into the pot and stir. Now back to the cutting board for the final mushrooms and tomatoes. Chop chop! Then put them in the pot and mix.
	Add your spices and tomato paste, mix well, then let this cook down for about five minutes. All of the veg should be softening, but not mushy. Nobody likes a mushy veg soup.
	Add your liquids. Cover, bring to a boil, then down to a simmer for about 10 minutes. Then voila! your soup is ready! Serve with a dollop of sour cream or yogurt and a crusty black bread. Yum!

Notes: Serve with yogurt and crusty dark bread

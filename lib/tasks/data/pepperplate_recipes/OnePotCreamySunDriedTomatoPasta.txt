Ingredients:
	2 cloves garlic
	4 cups broth
	3 cups milk (or 1 can coconut milk + 1 cup milk)
	16 oz. package of fettuccine (or ziti)
	20 pieces sun dried tomatoes
	1 tsp Freshly cracked pepper
	Parmesan

Instructions:
	Cut the sun dried tomatoes into small pieces and set aside.
	Mince the garlic and saut√© it in the bottom of the soup pot. (don't let it brown)
	Add the broth, milk, sun dried tomato pieces, and a healthy dose of freshly cracked pepper (15-20 cranks of a pepper mill) to the pot. If using bouillon cubes instead of broth, make sure it's properly stirred and dissolved.
	Add the fettuccine (break it in half first), and make sure the pasta is submerged below the liquid.
	Place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil.
	Once it reaches a boil, give it a quick stir to make sure the pasta is not stuck to the bottom.
	Turn the heat down to a simmer for about 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender.
	Stir briefly every 4-5 minutes as it simmers to keep the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
	If the pasta is still very soupy at that point, remove the lid and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes more, or until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. (The sauce will continue to thicken after the pasta is removed from the heat.)
	Once thickened, serve with Parmesan on top.

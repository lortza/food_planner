Ingredients:
	Ingredients
	2 tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil
	1/2 small yellow onion, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)
	1/4 green bell pepper, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)
	1 tbsp. Minced Garlic
	1/4 cup Capers (optional)
	1/4 cup Pitted Manzanilla Olives, sliced
	1 tsp. Oregano Leaves
	2 tbsp. Tomato Sauce
	1 can (15.5 oz.) Red Kidney Beans, drained and rinsed
	1 tsp. Salt
	1 cup CANILLAÂ® Extra Long Grain Rice
	1 tbsp. fresh cilantro, chopped

Instructions:
	Heat oil in medium, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat; add onion, bell pepper, garlic, capers (if using), olives and oregano. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables begin to soften and become fragrant, about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce.
	Stir kidney beans into pot until well combined. Add 3 cups water and bring to boil; season with salt.
	Stir in rice until well incorporated; reduce heat to medium. Simmer until water has evaporated, about 5-7 minutes. Stir rice once from bottom to top, scraping bottom of pot with spoon. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, until rice is tender, about 15-20 minutes. Add cilantro to pot; fluff rice with fork. Serve.

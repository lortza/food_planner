Ingredients:
	1 tablespoon olive, grapeseed, or safflower oil
	1 yellow onion, chopped
	2 poblano or hatch chili peppers, chopped
	3 cloves garlic, minced
	1 tablespoon grated or minced ginger
	1 teaspoon ground cumin
	1/2 teaspoon Harissa powder (more to taste--it's spicy, so feel free to add extra if you like heat!)
	1/2 teaspoon turmeric
	3/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
	1 lb sweet skinned and roughly chopped garnet yams or sweet potatoes (about 31/2-4 cups)
	1 1/4 cups yellow split peas, picked over to remove any grit
	6 cups water or low sodium vegetable broth
	1/2 cup soy, almond or light coconut milk
	Black pepper
	1/3 cup chopped green onion tops or cilantro (optional, for garnish)

Instructions:
	Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium high heat. Add the onion and peppers. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the onions are clear and soft. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring constantly, for another two minutes, until the garlic is quite fragrant. Add a few tablespoons of water as needed, to prevent ingredients from sticking.
	Add the ginger, cumin, harissa, turmeric, salt, sweet potatoes, split peas, and water or broth to the pot. Bring the soup to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer. Cook, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the lid and simmer for another ten minutes, so that the soup thickens up. Turn off the heat, stir in the non-dairy milk, and then season to taste with black pepper. Serve with a garnish of green onions or cilantro.

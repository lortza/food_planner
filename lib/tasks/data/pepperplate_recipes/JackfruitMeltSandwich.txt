Ingredients:
[for the jackfruit]
	1 box of plain jackfruit, rinsed and drained, finely chopped
	1/4 onion, diced (about a 1/2 cup)
	1 celery stick, finely chopped
	2 cloves garlic, minced
	1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon
	1 can cooked great northern white beans, drained, rinsed
	1/4 cup mayo
	2 tablespoons pickled relish
	1 1/2 tablespoons dijon mustard
	splash of lemon juice (a little goes far in this recipe)

[for the sandwich]
	bread
	greens of some sort (optional)
	tomato, sliced
	sliced swiss cheese

Instructions:
	Sautee onion & garlic
	Add tarragon, jackfruit, and beans to warm
	Once warmed, pour mixture into a bowl
	Mix with mayo, celery, mustard, relish, lemon juice, and mash it up together. Mashing the beans is nice, but don't expect to mash them completely.
	Lightly pre-toast the bread
	When done, put a slice of cheese on each face and toast it enough to melt it and harden the bread slightly
	Spoon some jackfruit mix onto a slice of bread, top with tomato & greens, put the other slice on and cut in half.
	Delicious hot or cold.

Ingredients:
	1 medium yucca root
	1 small head of white cabbage
	1 onion
	4 cloves of garlic
	8 oz dry egg noodles (or flat noodles of your liking)
	salt to taste

Instructions:
	Core the cabbage and slice it into ribbons.
	Peel the yucca, and cut into 1/2 inch cubes.
	Chop the onion and garlic.
	Add a little EVOO to the bottom of a big soup pot and toss it all in on medium heat. Add salt if youâ€™d like to. Stir and cover.
	Keep an eye on the yucca and test it for softness. When it is done, it will be very similar to a white potato, but just a little more firm.
	In about 20 minutes, start your noodles. If your noodles are done before the yucca mix, just drain them and set them aside. You can toss them with a little oil to keep them from sticking.
	When the yucca mix is ready, carefully mix in the noodles and serve immediately.

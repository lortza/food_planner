Ingredients:
	1/2 cup Once Again Organic Peanut Butter
	1/2 block tofu (firm) -- or 2 scrambled eggs
	1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
	1/4 cup warm water
	1/4 cup sweet chili sauce
	1/4 cup fresh lime juice
	2 tbsp rice vinegar
	1 tbsp dark brown sugar
	1 tbsp fresh ginger, peeled and minced
	2 teaspoon soy sauce
	2 teaspoon Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce
	1 clove garlic, chopped
	1 8 oz box or bag Pad Thai rice noodles
	1 cup carrots, julienned or shredded
	1 cup red bell peppers, julienned
	1 cup snow peas, julienned
	2 tbsp vegetable oil
	1 lime, wedged

Instructions:
	Crumble tofu and cook with a little oil in a sauce pan. Cook until dry and a little brown in places.
	Place the peanut butter, cilantro, water, sweet chili sauce, lime juice, rice vinegar, sugar, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, hot chili sauce and garlic in a blender. Pure until smooth. Set aside.
	Heat the vegetable oil over medium high heat. Add the vegetables, season lightly if desired, and saut for 3-4 minutes, until vegetables have softened but still maintain some crunch. Set aside.
	Cook the noodles in simmering salted water for 1-2 minutes. Rice noodles cook very quickly. Drain the noodles and place back in the pot.
	Reheat the peanut sauce and mix in the tofu crumbles.
	Toss the noodles in with the peanut sauce.
	To serve, arrange the noodles in a shallow bowl or on a plate. Top with a large scoop of the vegetables. Garnish with a lime wedge.
	Enjoy!

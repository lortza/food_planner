  :servings: 6
  :instructions: "Trim dark green leaves from leeks; discard all but 2. Tuck thyme,
    rosemary, and bay leaves inside leek leaves; tie closed with kitchen twine. Thinly
    slice light and pale-green parts of leeks.\r\n\r\nHeat butter in a large heavy
    pot over medium-high. Add celery and sliced leeks and season with salt and pepper.
    Cook, stirring, until leeks begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low,
    add herb bundle, cover pot, and cook, checking and stirring occasionally, until
    leeks and celery are very soft, 25–30 minutes (this long, slow cooking draws maximum
    flavor out of the vegetables). Increase heat to medium-high, add potato and 5
    cups broth, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally,
    until potato is very tender, 10–15 minutes. Let cool slightly.\r\n\r\nWorking
    in batches, purée leek mixture in a blender until very smooth (make sure lid is
    slightly ajar to let steam escape; cover with a towel). Transfer to a large bowl
    or pitcher.\r\nPour soup back into pot and add cream. Thin with broth, if needed.
    Taste and season with salt and pepper; keep warm.\r\n\r\nHeat oil in a small skillet
    over medium. Add almonds, sunflower seeds, and coriander seeds and sprinkle sugar
    over; cook, stirring, until nuts and seeds are golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer
    nuts to paper towels to drain; season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nServe soup
    topped with crème fraîche and nut mixture.\r\n\r\nDo ahead: Soup and nut mixture
    can be made 4 days ahead. Let soup cool; cover and chill. Store nut mixture airtight
    at room temperature."

  :servings: 6
  :instructions: "Prep work: Preheat the oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Stack the
    tortillas and slice them into 1/2-inch-wide, 2-inch-long strips. Remove the seeds
    and membranes from the jalapeno (and poblano, if using) and chop the peppers.
    Wash your hands. Pit, peel, and medium dice the avocado, then squeeze some lime
    juice over the avocado to prevent browning.\r\n\r\nBake the tortillas: Coat a
    baking sheet with a thin layer of oil. Toss the tortilla strips in the oil to
    coat and arrange the strips in a single layer. Bake 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden
    brown. While the strips are hot, season them with salt.\r\n\r\nToast the chili
    pepper: Place the dried chili pepper onto a baking sheet and bake for about 1
    minute, or until the pepper is warmed through. When cool enough to handle, cut
    the pepper open and remove the seeds. (Wash your hands afterward and avoid touching
    your eyes!)\r\n\r\nMake the soup: In a medium pot or Dutch oven, heat some olive
    oil on medium until hot. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno and poblano peppers (if
    using). Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until softened, stirring occasionally. Stir in
    the cumin, then the canned tomatoes and vegetable stock. Simmer for about 3 minutes,
    then add the hominy, black beans and the seeded chili pepper. Cook for 8 to 10
    minutes, or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Season with salt
    and pepper to taste.\r\n\r\nServe the soup: First, discard the dried chili pepper.
    Place some of the avocado, radishes, tortilla strips, and queso fresco (or feta)
    at the bottom of 2 to 4 bowls. Divide the soup between the bowls. Top the soup
    with the remaining avocado, radishes, tortilla strips, and queso fresco (or feta).
    Garnish with some cilantro and serve with lime wedges and hot sauce, if desired.\r\n"

  :source_name: Budget Bytes
  :source_url: http://www.budgetbytes.com/2014/06/chorizo-sweet-potato-skillet/
  :servings: 6
  :instructions: "Peel and dice the sweet potato into 1/2 to 3/4 inch cubes (size
    matters, make them small). Sauté the sweet potato cubes in a large skillet with
    olive oil over medium heat for about 5 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes have
    softened about half way through (they'll cook more later).\r\n\r\nSqueeze the
    chorizo out of its casing into the skillet with the sweet potatoes. Sauté the
    chorizo and sweet potatoes together, breaking the chorizo up into small pieces
    as it browns.\r\n\r\nOnce the chorizo is fully browned, pour off any excess grease
    if needed. Rinse and drain the black beans. Add the beans, salsa, and uncooked
    rice to the skillet. Stir them into the sweet potatoes and chorizo until everything
    is well combined.\r\n\r\nAdd the chicken broth, stir briefly, then place a lid
    on the skillet. Allow the contents of the skillet to come up to a boil, then turn
    the heat down to low. Let the skillet simmer on low for 30 minutes. Make sure
    it is simmering the whole time (you should be able to hear it quietly simmer away).
    If it is not, turn the heat up slightly.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 minutes the rice should
    be tender and have absorbed all of the liquid. Turn off the heat, fluff the mixture,
    sprinkle the cheese on top, then return the lid to trap the residual heat and
    help the cheese melt. Slice the green onions while the cheese is melting, then
    sprinkle them on top and serve.\r\n"

  :servings: 4
  :instructions: "Preheat oven to 350F.\r\n\r\nPlace the potatoes on a small baking
    sheet. Drizzle with a little EVOO and rub them with some salt and freshly ground
    black pepper. Bake them 45 minutes to an hour, until tender. When the potatoes
    have finished baking, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool enough
    that you can handle them.\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are cooling, heat a small
    skillet over medium heat and saut the chorizo until crisp, 4-5 minutes. Remove
    the cooked chorizo from the pan to a paper towel-lined plate and reserve. Preheat
    broiler to high.\r\n\r\nWhen youre able to handle the potatoes, cut them lengthwise,
    being careful not to cut them all the way through (you should be able to open
    the potato like a book). Scoop out the cooked insides using a spoon, then transfer
    them to the same pan you cooked the chorizo in. Make sure not pierce the skin
    of the potato, you want it to keep its shape.\r\n\r\nTo the pan, add the chicken
    stock, butter, pumpkin, honey, garlic, chipotle and adobo sauce, orange zest,
    juice of 1/2 orange, nutmeg, salt and freshly ground pepper. Mash everything together
    using a potato masher.\r\n\r\nCarefully refill the potato skin shells with the
    mashed potato mixture and transfer them back to the baking sheet. Top each potato
    with some of the reserved crispy chorizo and a small handful of shredded cheese.
    Place the potatoes under the broiler to melt the cheese, about 1 minute.\r\n\r\nTo
    serve, top each potato with some chopped scallions and serve a simple salad alongside."

  :source_name: Budget Bytes
  :source_url: https://www.budgetbytes.com/enfrijoladas-tortillas-in-black-bean-sauce/
  :servings: 6
  :instructions: "To make the black bean sauce, combine the drained black beans, chipotle
    peppers plus about 1 Tbsp of the adobo sauce, 1/4 of the sweet onion (diced),
    cumin, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Starting with one cup, add the
    broth as you blend until a smooth, thick sauce forms. Taste and adjust the salt
    as needed (this will depend on the salt content of the broth you use).\r\n\r\nPreheat
    the oven to 350ºF. Heat the tortillas by either microwaving the stack for 30 seconds,
    toasting them in a skillet, or directly on a gas burner until lightly browned.
    Cover the stacked warmed tortillas with foil to retain the heat and steam.\r\n\r\nFinely
    dice the rest of the sweet onion. Roughly chop the cilantro leaves, add them to
    the diced onion along with a pinch of salt, and stir to combine. Set the onion
    and cilantro mixture aside to marinate.\r\n\r\nPour a small amount of the black
    bean sauce into a casserole dish and spread it around to cover the bottom. Pour
    more sauce into a wide shallow bowl or dish for dipping the tortillas.\r\n\r\nOne
    by one, dip the tortillas in the black bean sauce until both sides are coated
    in the thick sauce. Sprinkle a little cheese and a little of the onion cilantro
    mixture over half of the tortilla, fold it closed, then fold in half once more
    to make a triangle. Place the dipped, filled, and folded tortillas in the prepared
    casserole dish. Be careful to only place a very small amount of filling in the
    tortillas to make them easier to fold. More filling will be placed on top after
    baking.\r\n\r\nOnce all the tortillas are dipped, filled, folded, and placed in
    the casserole dish, pour any remaining black bean sauce over top. Bake the tortillas
    in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes, or just until heated through. Top
    with the remaining cheese and onion cilantro mixture after baking, then serve.\r\n\r\nRECIPE
    NOTES\r\n\r\nI use Better Than Bouillon to mix up broth when I need it and in
    the amount that I need."

  :instructions: "Make Queso: <a href=\"http://www.pepperplate.com/recipes/view.aspx?id=22615079\">Cashew
    Vegan Queso</a>\r\n\r\nPreheat the oven to 400ºF. In a small bowl combine the
    smoked paprika, granulated garlic, cayenne, salt, and some freshly cracked pepper.\r\n\r\nSpread
    the frozen cauliflower florets out onto a baking sheet (no need to thaw first),
    then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle the spices over top. Toss the cauliflower
    in the oil and spices until they are fairly evenly coated.\r\n\r\nTransfer the
    seasoned cauliflower to the preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes, stirring
    once half way through.\r\n\r\nAbout half way through the roasting time, begin
    the cheese sauce. Add the evaporated milk and butter to a small sauce pot. Heat
    over medium, while stirring, until the butter has melted and the evaporated milk
    is hot. This should only take a couple of minutes.\r\n\r\nTurn the heat under
    the evaporated milk to LOW and begin whisking in the shredded cheddar, one handful
    at a time, making sure the cheese is fully melted before adding the next handful.
    Once all the cheese is melted into the evaporated milk the sauce will thicken.
    If it's still very liquidy, keep the sauce over low heat and whisk constantly
    until it thickens. Often the cheese appears to be completely melted, but it has
    not yet totally emulsified. Remove the cheese sauce from the heat until ready
    to serve.*\r\n\r\nOnce the cauliflower has finished roasting, divide it into bowls
    or place it in a serving platter, then pour the cheese sauce over top. Serve immediately."

    oil then the onions, celery, red pepper. \r\n\r\nSauté for about two or three
    minutes then add the mushrooms, eggplant and zucchini. \r\nContinue cooking for

    Gruyere in and give it all a little toss to get the cubes coated and to spread
    the love.\r\n\r\nAt this point, you can cover the dish up with wrap and put it
    in the fridge for later. Just remember to take the casserole out at least 20 minutes
    before baking.\r\n\r\nIf you are ready to bake, place the dish in the preheated

    the pasta (Use the large soup pot because we're going to put the pasta back in
    it) NOTE: Don't drain the pasta without consulting the next step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet
    aside about a cup of pasta water when you strain the pasta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd
    2 tablespoon oil to the bottom of the soup pot then put the pasta back in and stir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately
    add the goat cheese, garlic, and red pepper flakes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPut the small
    mesh strainer over the pot and juice the lemon into the mix. (you may have to
    put one end of the strainer on the pot and the other on a wooden spoon across
    the pot)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd about 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water
    and gently toss the pasta until the ingredients are evenly mixed together and
    the pasta is coated in a light sauce (add more reserved cooking water if the pasta
    seems dry).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the tomatoes and squash are done, pour the whole
    thing into the pot, jusices and all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeason to taste with salt and
    pepper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStir in the basil and oregano"

Ingredients:
	1 cup quinoa, rinsed under running water in a fine mesh colander for a couple of minutes
	1 cup light coconut milk
	1 small bunch of kale, stems removed and leaves chopped (for a total of about 4 cups chopped kale)
	1/3 cup chopped red onion
	1/3 cup large, unsweetened coconut flakes*

[Tropical Cilantro-Cashew Pesto]
	2 cups cilantro, packed
	scant 1/2 cup cashews
	4 cloves garlic
	1/2 cup olive oil
	salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
	1/2 lime, juiced (or more, to taste)
	pinch red pepper flakes, optional

Instructions:
	In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup coconut milk and 1 cup water, and bring to a boil. Add the quinoa, cover and simmer for 15 to 17 minutes, until the water is absorbed. Remove from heat, fluff with a fork and mix in the red onion. Cover and set aside.
	Make the pesto: combine cilantro, cashews and garlic in a food processor. Start processing the mixture, and slowly drizzle in the olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, lime juice and red pepper flakes, all to taste, and blend well.
	In a medium serving bowl, combine the warm coconut quinoa, chopped kale and pesto. Mix well with a big spoon and season to taste with salt and pepper, if necessary.
	In a skillet over medium heat, toast the coconut flakes for a few minutes until golden and fragrant, stirring often. Top the salad with coconut flakes and serve warm.

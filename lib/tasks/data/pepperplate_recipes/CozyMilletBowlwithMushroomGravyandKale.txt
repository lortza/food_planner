Ingredients:
	1/2 cup uncooked millet (makes ~2 cups cooked)
	1/2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
	2 cups chopped sweet onion (1 medium onion)
	3 garlic cloves, minced
	4 cups sliced crimini mushrooms (300 grams)
	1.5 tbsp minced fresh rosemary
	2 tbsp nutritional yeast
	1.5 tbsp low-sodium tamari (soy sauce)
	1/2 tbsp cornstarch <-- use a little flour instead
	1 & 1/4 cup vegetable broth
	1 cup fresh chopped kale, stems removed <-- use frozen if we have it
	1 pinch Freshly ground black pepper
	1/4 tsp kosher salt, to taste

Instructions:
	Toast millet (optional): In a pot or skillet with a lid, toast the millet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it starts popping. Be careful you don’t burn it. The goal here is a light toast. Remove from heat. Cook millet: Bring a medium-sized pot of 1 cup water, a pinch of salt, and 1/2 cup uncooked millet to a low boil. Reduce heat to low and cover with tight-fitting lid (with no air holes). Simmer for 15-20 minutes or so. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 minutes covered. Remove lid and fluff with fork. Set aside.
	Meanwhile, grab a large skillet and heat oil over medium heat. Add in chopped onions and garlic and sauté for about 5 minutes.
	Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté for about 12 minutes longer, stirring as necessary. Now stir in the rosemary, nutritional yeast, and tamari. Cook for a few minutes.
	In a small bowl, whisk together the broth and cornstarch until clumps are gone, and then stir into the mushroom mixture. Stir in kale. Cook for another 5-6 minutes or so, until slightly thickened. Portion millet into two bowls and serve the mushroom gravy on top.

Ingredients:
	1 can white beans
	1 cup almond milk
	1/2 bag shell pasta
	1 small onion
	3 cloves garlic
	1 tbs dried basil
	1 tbs dried oregano
	EVOO
	Parmesan cheese
	salt to taste

Instructions:
	Cook the pasta.
	While pasta is cooking, drain beans (leaving a little liquid) and cook on medium in a flat and wide sauce pan or a soup pot with the onion and garlic.
	The beans will soften quickly.
	Add 1/8 cup of the almond milk, stir, then use a masher (or the bottoms of two water glasses) to mash the beans into a more or less even consistency.
	Add spices and salt.
	Add another 1/8 cup of almond milk, stir. Check for consistency. If you'd like it a little saucier, add more almond milk.
	At this point, the pasta should be ready, so drain it thoroughly, then pour it into the bean sauce and mix.
	Serve with your favorite crusty bread and topped with parmesan.

Ingredients:
[Dressing]
	1/2 cup olive oil
	1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped into big pieces
	2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
	1 lime, juiced
	2 tablespoons agave nectar
	3/4 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
	1 clove garlic
	totally optional: 1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, which isn’t raw, but tastes good!

[Salad]
	5 big stalks of kale
	Sea salt
	Raw red pepper and ginger salad dressing (see recipe above)
	1/2 avocado, cubed
	1 red bell pepper, chopped
	1 carrot, peeled and sliced into strips with a vegetable peeler
	1 tablespoon cilantro, roughly chopped
	1 tablespoon red onion, thinly sliced
	1 teaspoon sesame seeds
	1 bunch of broccolini
	3 tablespoons purple cabbage, chopped (optional)

Instructions:
	First you have to make the dressing. Simply blend all dressing ingredients thoroughly in a food processor or blender.
	Pull the kale leaves off from the tough stem, and break into small, bite sized pieces. Sprinkle with sea salt and massage the leaves for a couple of minutes, meaning that you should scrunch handfuls of kale in your hands, release, repeat. The kale will become darker in color and more fragrant. This step improves the taste of raw kale.
	Throw the kale into a bowl, drizzle in the salad dressing (don’t skimp), and toss thoroughly.
	Add the avocado, carrots, cabbage and red onion.
	Top with cilantro and a big sprinkle of sesame seeds. Enjoy!

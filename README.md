## Heroku Scheduler
Heroku runs a cron job to add the weekly shopping_list items to the grocery list. This is accomplished with a rake task plus the cron job. The job is set to run daily because heroku doesn't offer a weekly interval. The rake task has a condition to only allow it to run on a specific day of the week. [Configure the cron job](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/myfoodplanner/scheduler).

This feature is dependent on my account having both a list named "grocery" and another list named "weekly items." Without either of those specifically-named lists, this job will error.

## Editing the credentials file
Never open the `master.key` or `credentials.yml.enc` in atom. This will add newline characters that you can't remove and it will not be able to be unencrypted.

To edit this file, run:
```
EDITOR="atom --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```
If this file gets borked, [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54279636/5009528) and [this post](https://medium.com/@kirill_shevch/encrypted-secrets-credentials-in-rails-6-rails-5-1-5-2-f470accd62fc) will help.

## Deploying
* log into Heroku CLI with `heroku login`
* assuming your local copy of the `main` branch is up to date, run `git push heroku main`

Ingredients:
[Salad]
	1 bunch kale (preferably lacinato/Tuscan/dinosaur kale but regular curly kale works, too)
	1/2 teaspoon fine-grain sea salt
	1 cup chopped snow peas (slice off tough ends first)
	1 large carrot, peeled and ribboned with a vegetable peeler
	1 small red bell pepper, deseeded and chopped
	1 heaping cup organic edamame (if using frozen edamame, defrost by tossing into a pot of boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes)
	1 avocado, pitted and sliced into small chunks
	1/4 red onion finely sliced
	1/4 bunch cilantro, chopped
	10 Thai basil (or regular basil) leaves, chopped
	1 lime

[Tamari-Ginger Vinaigrette]
	1/4 cup olive oil
	3 tablespoons rice vinegar
	1 tablespoon ginger, finely minced
	1 tablespoon low-sodium tamari (or other low-sodium soy sauce*)
	1 garlic clove, minced <-- skip this

Instructions:
	Start thawing the edamame on the stove
	Wash and debone kale.
	To chop, stack 2-3 leaves, roll, then slice the rolls
	Place chopped kale into big glass bowl
	Roll the lime under your hand on the cutting board, then cut in half
	Place the fine metal strainer over the bowl
	Use a fork to juice the lime into the bowl through the strainer
	Sprinkle the kale with salt, then squeeze the kale until it all softens, becoming darker green and more fragrant
	Chop the other vegetables and put in the bowl with the kale
	Drain and add the edamame
	Using the thongs, toss the remaining salad dressing ingredients with the kale.

Notes: be careful with shallots! some of them have been crappy lately and have overpowered and ruined the salad.

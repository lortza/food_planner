Ingredients:
	2 tablespoons olive oil
	4 cloves garlic, minced
	2/3 cup sliced almonds
	1 teaspoon smoked paprika
	2 1/4 cups water
	2 cups couscous
	3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
	2/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves

Instructions:
	Heat the oil over medium heat in a large saucepan or Dutch oven until shimmering. Add the garlic and almonds and sauté until the garlic is fragrant and the nuts are lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add the paprika and sauté for 10 seconds more.
	Add the water, stir to combine, and bring the mixture to a boil. Turn off the heat and immediately stir in the couscous and salt. Cover and let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Uncover the couscous and fluff with a fork. Mix in the parsley and serve.

Notes: The first time i made this, i stepped away from the almonds and they burnt quickly. Be careful! They go from amazing to burnt in the blink of an eye.

Ingredients:
	1 Onion
	1 Tbsp Olive Oil
	1 teaspoon Cumin
	2 Medium Carrots (chopped)
	1.5 cup (200g) Dried Red Lentils
	5 cups (960ml) Vegetable Stock/Broth
	Crusty bread

Instructions:
	Peel and chop the onion and add to a pot with the olive oil and cumin and sauté until slightly softened.
	Add the carrots and toss together. Then the lentils and toss together with the other vegetables. Finally, add in the vegetable stock and mix together.
	Bring to the boil and then reduce heat, cover the pot and simmer until the lentils are cooked (they should be soft).
	Take the pot off the heat and blend directly in the pot using an immersion blender. If you don’t have an immersion blender, then transfer to your blender jug and blend up in stages until it’s all smooth.
	Serve into bowls and garnish with black pepper.

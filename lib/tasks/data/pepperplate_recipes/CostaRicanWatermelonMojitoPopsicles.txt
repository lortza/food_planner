Ingredients:
	3 cups Watermelon, cubed
	4 ounces freshly squeezed Lemon Juice
	5 ounces White Rum
	4 ounces Simple Syrup
	12 large Spearmint leaves, rough chopped

Instructions:
	Blend all ingredients on high until fully incorporated. Pour into popsicle molds; cover and insert wooden sticks. Tip: applying a layer of foil over the top of the mold or lid of the mold allows placement of wooden sticks and they will not float out of the mold.
	Freeze for several hours or overnight. Run hot water for a few seconds on the outside of the mold to release pops!

Ingredients:
	6 ripe tomatoes (about 3 lbs), peeled and chopped (yielding about 6 cups)
	1 red onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)
	1 cucumber, peeled, seeded, chopped (about 1 cup)
	1 sweet red bell pepper (or green) seeded and chopped (about 1 cup)
	2 stalks celery, chopped (about 1 cup)
	1 to 2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley
	2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives
	1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
	1/4 cup red wine vinegar
	1/4 cup olive oil
	1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice
	2 teaspoons sugar (more may be needed to balance out the acidity of the tomatoes, add to taste)
	Salt and fresh ground pepper to taste
	6 or more drops of Tabasco sauce to taste
	1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce (omit for vegetarian option)
	2 cups tomato juice (or 1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes if you don't have tomato juice)

Instructions:
	Place all ingredients in a large bowl. Use an immersion blender or blend in batches, to desired smoothness. We prefer our gazpacho somewhat chunky, so only pulse a few times in the blender.
	Adjust seasonings to taste.
	Place in a non-reactive container (tomatoes are acidic) to store. Chill several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to blend.

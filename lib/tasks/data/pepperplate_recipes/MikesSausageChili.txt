Ingredients:
	Some(2 tablespoonsish?) ermirl's essence seasoning (see related recipe)
	2 tablespoons chili powder
	2 teaspoons ground cumin
	1 lb of vegetarian sausage such as field roast
	1 medium yellow onion, chopped
	1 tablespoon minced garlic
	1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer
	2 (28-ounce) can whole tomatoes, crushed, and their juices
	1 teaspoon sugar
	1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
	1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
	1 cup grated cheddar cheese, garnish

Instructions:
	In a large heavy pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and brown on all sides, about 10-15 minutes.
	Add the onions, garlic, chili powder, Essence, and cumin and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 4 minutes.
	Deglaze the pan with the beer and cook until the foam subsides, about 1 minute.
	Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, and kidney beans to the pot. Stir well and bring to a boil.
	Lower the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the chili from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
	Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.
	Remove from the heat.
	When serving, sprinkle each serving with grated cheese and green onions, and serve hot.

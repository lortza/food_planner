Ingredients:
[Produce]
	1 bunch broccoli, finely chopped

[Cans & Dry Goods]
	1 cup couscous
	1.5 cups broth
	1 cup canned chickpeas, rinsed <-- use 1 can great northern beans
	1/2 cup golden raisins

[Spices]
	1 teaspoon curry powder
	1/2 tsp kosher salt

Instructions:
[Make Couscous]
	Using the medium sauce pan, bring the broth to a boil
	Stir in the couscous, a pinch of salt, and a splash of oil
	Cover with a lid, remove from heat. (It will continue to steam and absorb the water while you're cooking the veg)

[Cook the veg]
	In the large frying pan, heat coconut oil over medium-high heat.
	Add the broccoli and cook, tossing occasionally, until tender, approx 10 mins.
	Add the beans, raisins, salt, and curry powder.
	Stir well to combine the curry and cook it a bit.

[Combine]
	When the veg & couscous are done, fluff the couscous and pour it into the veg and stir to combine all of the things.
	Cover with a lid, turn off the heat, and let it commingle for a few minutes before serving.

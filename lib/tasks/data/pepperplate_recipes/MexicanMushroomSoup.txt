Ingredients:
	3 large garlic cloves (left unpeeled)
	1/2 in white onion (thick slice large)
	3 inches dried ancho chile (long small, *, 1/4 ounce)
	1/2 cup water
	3/4 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (preferably Mexican, crumbled)
	2 tbsps vegetable oil
	10 ozs mushrooms (trimmed and thinly sliced)
	1 tbsp tomato paste
	3 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth (28 fluid ounces)

Instructions:
	Heat a dry 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot, 3 to 5 minutes. Lightly smash garlic in skins with side of a large knife, then add to skillet along with onion slice and cook, turning over once or twice with tongs, until onion is well browned and garlic is slightly softened, about 8 minutes.
	Meanwhile, discard stem, seeds, and veins from chile and tear chile into 4 pieces. Add chile to onion and garlic in skillet and toast, pressing flat with tongs and turning over occasionally, until chile turns a brighter red, about 1 minute.
	Discard garlic skins and coarsely chop onion, then purée garlic, onion, and chile in a blender with water, salt, and oregano until smooth.
	Heat oil in skillet over high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until golden and any liquid is evaporated, about 6 minutes. Reduce heat to moderate, then add tomato paste and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add purée and cook, stirring, 3 minutes. Stir in broth and simmer 5 minutes.

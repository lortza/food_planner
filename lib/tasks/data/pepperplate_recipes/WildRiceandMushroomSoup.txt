Ingredients:
	5 medium carrots, chopped
	5 stalks celery, chopped
	half of an onion, chopped
	3 cloves garlic, minced
	1 cup uncooked wild rice (see notes)
	8 ounces fresh mushrooms, sliced
	4 cups vegetable or chicken broth
	1 teaspoon salt
	1 teaspoon poultry seasoning (see notes)
	1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
	Questionable adds:
	6 tablespoons butter
	1/2 cup flour
	1 1/2 cups milk (I used 2%)

Instructions:
	Stovetop: When the soup is done, melt the butter in a saucepan. Whisk in the flour. Let the mixture cook for a minute or two to remove the floury taste. Whisk the milk, a little bit at a time, until you have a smooth, thickened sauce. Throw a little salt in there for good measure.

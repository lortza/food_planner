Ingredients:
[Vegetables]
	1 Cauliflower, broken into small florets
	2 small red onion, sliced into rings for roasting
	1/2 bunch chopped cilantro
	2 lemons (zest and juice)
	1 clove garlic, crushed <-- skip this one
	1/4 large avocado

[Canned & Dry Goods]
	1/2 cup raisins
	1/2 cup toasted, shaved almonds
	1 tablespoon raw honey
	4 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar

[Spices]
	1 tablespoon turmeric
	1/4 teaspoon himalayan sea salt

Instructions:
	Heat your oven to 350F.
	Toss the cauliflower florets with coconut oil -- really rub it into them.
	Lube up the baking sheet and place the cauliflower on it in one layer
	Sprinkle with black pepper and sea salt and roast on the top rack for 15 minutes.
	After 15 minutes, add in the sliced red onion on top of the cauliflower and cook for another 15-20 minutes until nice and tender.
	Spread the almonds into a pie plate. Put them in the oven on the bottom rack. They will need to be stirred frequently and can burn suddenly. Keep an eye on them.
	Once the cauliflower & onions are done, transfer them into the big soup pot (if available) or the big glass bowl.
	Combine the almonds (when they're done), raisins (sultanas) and cilantro to the cauliflower and red onion mix.
	In a small glass bowl, zest the lemons (using the little shredder), then juice them over a strainer
	Remove the strainer, add the turmeric (1 tbsp), vinegar (4 tbsp), honey (1 tbsp), salt (1/4 tsp), mix well
	Pour the dressing over the cauliflower and mix evenly
	Serve with avocado slices on the side

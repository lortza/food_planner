Ingredients:
	1 premade pie crust (frozen, in an aluminum dish is super easy)
	1 tomato, diced and drained
	1/2 frozen chopped spinach (thawed)
	6 eggs
	1/4 cup feta
	pinch of garlic powder
	pinch of onion powder
	1/2 tsp basil
	1/2 tsp oregano
	1/8 tsp salt

Instructions:
	Preheat oven 350F (or just use a toaster oven so you don't have to preheat)
	Prebake the crust for about 10 mi. Keep an eye on it because you don't want it to get too deformed in the process. You don't have to prebake, but it keeps the bottom of the crust from getting mushy from the eggs.
	While the crust is prebaking, prepare your tomato and spinach
	When the crust is done, whisk the eggs and herbs/spices thoroughly
	Mix in the feta, tomato, and spinach
	Pour into shell
	Bake about 45 min

Ingredients:
	1 bulb large kohlrabi
	1 sprig fresh thyme
	1 sprig fresh rosemary
	3 cloves garlic
	1/2 tsp salt
	1 tbsp EVOO

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 450F.
	Mince your garlic. Pick the leaves off the herbs. Throw them in a bowl with the salt and olive oil. Mix.
	Get to peeling that kohlrabi. Depending on your peeler, this could be hard work. You will be earning this dish, as well you should if you're also trying to redeem yourself.
	Once peeled, cut the kohlrabi into 1/2 inch cubes. Toss them into the olive oil mixture to coat.
	Spread kohlrabi in a single layer on a baking sheet or dish.
	Bake until browned, 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
	Once they're evenly browned and nicely poke-able with a fork, they're done.
	Serve as a side to one of your favorite fall or winter meals.

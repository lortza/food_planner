Ingredients:
	1 quart (box) of vegetable stock
	1/2 quart of almond or coconut milk, unsweetened, plain
	6 medium red potatoes, finely diced
	1 large leek chopped (and rinsed very well to get rid of all of the dirt). use both the white and the greens.
	3 cloves of garlic, minced
	2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
	4 sprigs of fresh thyme
	3 fresh bay leaves
	salt to taste

Instructions:
	Chop and rinse your leek. My favorite way to do this is to put a colander inside a big bowl toss the leek pieces in. Fill with water, agitate, and let it sit for about 10 minutes to let the dirt settle to the bottom. Then lift the colander and your leek is good to go.
	Shred (or mince) the potatoes and then boil them in the vegetable stock.
	Prep the rosemary and thyme by harvesting all of the green parts and chopping them.
	Just before the potatoes are soft, add the leek, garlic, herbs, bay leaves, and almond/coconut milk.
	Simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the liquid/potato ratio meets your liking.
	Sprinkle with a little parmesan cheese on top. Serve with a hearty bread.

Description: SOAK BEANS 2 DAYS PRIOR
I recommend making a 1/2 recipe because the full recipe (shown below) is just too much food.

Ingredients:
	2 cups uncooked rice
	1 medium yellow onion
	1 medium bell pepper
	4 stalks celery
	4 cloves garlic
	1 lb. dry red beans (1 lb = 2 cups / 1 cup = 1/2 lb)
	6 cups vegetable broth
	1 teaspoon thyme
	1 teaspoon oregano
	1 whole bay leaf
	1/2 Tbsp smoked paprika
	1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper (10-15 cranks of a mill)
	1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
	1 bunch green onions, sliced

Instructions:
[TWO DAYS BEFORE]
	Place your beans in a large pot and fill with enough cool water to cover the beans by a few inches. Place the beans in the refrigerator to soak over night.

[Today]
	Get out the big canning pot and use it. The steam buildup cooked the beans faster than they would have cooked in the regular soup pot.
	Finely dice the celery, bell pepper, and onion, and mince the garlic.
	Sautee the vegetables in the bottom of the big stock pot until softened
	Drain the soaked beans in a colander and rinse with fresh, cool water. Add the rinsed beans to the pot with the vegetables.
	Add the broth, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, paprika, pepper, and cayenne.
	Place a lid on the pot and bring it up to a full boil over high heat.
	After it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow the pot to simmer for at least two hours. <-- using the stock pot and a half-recipe reduces this time to about half
	Stir the pot occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom, but the steam is dangerous and crucial. Do this carefully and quickly. Get the lid back on asap.
	Mash some of the beans against the side of the pot with the back of a spoon. This will thicken the pot and make the classic, creamy texture of the dish.
	Remove the bay leaf and allow the pot to simmer for about 30 minutes more (after smashing) to help it thicken.
	Start the rice.
	To serve, add a scoop of rice to a bowl and top with a beans.
	Top with yogurt and green onions

Notes: I like making a 1/2 recipe because the full recipe is just too much.

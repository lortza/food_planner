Ingredients:
	4 eggs
	1/8 cup cheese (I used cheddar because that’s what I had, but a dill havarti would ave been really nice)
	1/2 cup dry/uncooked quinoa (which you need to cook)
	1/2 small white onion
	1 small carrot or 4 baby carrots
	1/8 cup celery
	1/4 cup zucchini
	1/8 cup chayote
	1/2 red bell pepper (we used 6 tiny red mystery peppers from the back yard)
	1/4 anaheim pepper
	4 large cherry or grape tomatoes
	1/8 cup chopped fresh parsley
	1/4 cup chopped fresh kale
	1/4 cup chopped fresh spinach
	1 teaspoon garlic salt (or sea salt)

Instructions:
	Preheat your oven. Our oven here in Panama has settings of 1-4. We chose 3. As it turned out, 3 worked just fine.
	Cook the quinoa and set it aside (1 cup of boiling water, 1/2 cup dry quinoa, simmer low until water is gone).
	Finely dice all of the vegetables that will need to be sautéed: onion, carrot, celery, zucchini, chayote, bell pepper, anaheim pepper, and set them aside in a frying pan.
	Finely dice all of the vegetables that will not be sautéed: tomatoes, parsley, kale, spinach, and set them aside in a bowl.
	Sautee or steam fry the vegetables. I didn’t use any oil here, just kept moving them around the pan quickly for a few minutes until they became aromatic and the onions became translucent. When they’re ready, take them off the heat.
	In a large mixing bowl, beat all 4 eggs.
	Dice the cheese, and mix it into the eggs along with the salt.
	Prepare a 4×9″ baking dish by rubbing about 1.5 teaspoon olive oil along the bottom and sides.
	Slowly add the quinoa to the eggs, mixing well.
	Add the uncooked vegetables to the mix, stir, then mix in the cooked vegetables.
	Transfer the whole mix to the baking dish, and spread it evenly.
	Bake for 30 minutes.
	Serve with a hearty rye or your favorite artisan bread

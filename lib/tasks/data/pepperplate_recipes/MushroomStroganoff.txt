Ingredients:
	This recipe has been modified from the original:
	1/2 bag of egg noodles
	2/3 cup raw cashews
	1 tablespoon red wine or apple cider vinegar
	Pinch fine sea salt
	1 1/2 pound assorted mushrooms
	1 red onion, thinly sliced
	2 1/2 cup mushroom broth or low-sodium vegetable broth
	1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
	1 tablespoon paprika
	1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
	1 tablespoon dill
	3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Instructions:
[Prep Cashew Cream (45 min)]
	Place cashews in a small bowl and cover by about 1 inch with boiling water. Let soak 30 minutes. Drain, discarding soaking liquid.
	In a blender, combine cashews, 1/4 cup water, vinegar and salt, and then blend until smooth
	Add more water a tablespoon at a time as needed to make a cashew cream.

[Noodles]
	Get the noodles started.

[Prep the Mushroom Sauce]
	While the cashews are soaking, halve or quarter smaller mushrooms and thickly slice larger ones.
	Mince the red onion
	Place mushrooms and onion in a the soup pot over medium heat. Cook, adding broth if needed, until mushrooms are browned and softened, 10 to 12 minutes.
	Stir in remaining broth, mustard, paprika, dill, and pepper.
	Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer until mushrooms are very tender and sauce is thickened, about 25 minutes.
	Stir in the cashew cream.
	When the noodles are done, stir them in and cover them completely with sauce. **If you've made a double batch, set aside half of the sauce before adding the noodles
	Serve.

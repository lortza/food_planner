Ingredients:
	1/2 cup lentils (masoor dal)
	1 cup of carrots, sliced in 1/2 inch pieces
	1/2 cup of green string beans, sliced 1/2 inch pieces
	1 cup of celery, sliced in 1/2 inch pieces
	3 medium size tomatoes cut into 8 pieces
	About 1/2 inch ginger thin sliced
	1 1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/2 teaspoon turmeric (haldi)
	1/2 teaspoon black pepper
	2 tablespoon clarified butter (ghee) or 2 tablespoons oil
	1/2 teaspoon cumin seed (jeera)
	1/2 teaspoon garam masala
	Half a lemon

Instructions:
	Wash lentils and soak in 2 cups of water for 1 hour or longer. Once soaked, the lentils should be about double in volume.
	Heat 4 cups of water in a pressure cooker on medium high heat. Next add soaked lentils, salt, turmeric, black pepper, ginger, carrots, green beans, celery, and tomatoes.
	Close the pressure cooker and put the weight (or seal the exhaust).
	As the pressure cooker starts steaming turn the heat down to medium and cook for about 6 minutes.
	Turn off the heat and wait until steam has stopped before opening the pressure cooker.
	Mix dal well, if dal is thick add more boiling water and make the consistency as you desire. Soup should be chunky.
	For seasoning (chaunk) heat the butter in a small saucepan, add cumin seeds and wait until cumin seed crack. Then pour it over the soup.
	Add garam masala to the soup and mix it well.
	Before serving squeeze a few drops of lemon juice.

Ingredients:
[BBQ Tempeh]
	1 8-ounce package of tempeh, sliced to make short strips, 1/4 inch thick
	1 cup BBQ sauce
	1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil

[Collard Greens]
	1/2 sweet onion, sliced
	1.5 pounds collard greens - rinsed, trimmed and chopped
	1/2 cup water
	3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
	2 tablespoons honey
	1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root
	5 tablespoons melted butter
	0.25 teaspoon salt
	0.25 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Instructions:
[Tempeh Option 1: Toaster Oven <-- easier]
	Spray oil on the bottom of a metal pie plate
	Slice the tempeh and lay them in one layer in the pie plate
	Cover completely with sauce
	Bake in toaster oven for 30 min (just guessing here on the time)

[Tempeh Option 2: On the Stove]
	Combine tempeh and BBQ sauce in a bowl. Gently stir to coat all sides of tempeh slices. Marinate for 5-10 minutes
	Heat oil in the small frying pan over medium heat. Add tempeh and cook till each side is golden brown, about 4-5 minutes per side.
	Serve with Tangy Power Greens (previous recipe). Enjoy!

[Collard Greens]
	Heat oil in large skillet over medium heat.
	Add onion and cook, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes.
	Stir in collard greens, in batches if necessary, until they wilt slightly and all fit in the skillet.
	Pour in water and cook, stirring occasionally, until bright green and tender, 5 to 7 minutes, regulating heat to prevent burning.
	Drain the greens completely.
	Whisk vinegar, honey, ginger and butter together in a little bowl for dressing.
	Pour the dressing in with the greens and stir well to combine.

[Combine]
	Put the greens in a little pile on a plate.
	Top with Tempeh.

Ingredients:
	1 egg, hard-boiled (optional)
	0.5 cup dried lentils, sorted
	1.5 cups broth
	2 bay leaves
	1 medium potato, diced
	0.5 cup onion, diced
	1 small carrot, diced
	2 large vine tomatoes, sliced 1/4 inch
	0.5 teaspoon basil
	0.5 teaspoon oregano
	0.5 teaspoon salt
	0.25 cup shredded parmesan cheese (optional)
	pepper and salt to taste
	1 pie crust (ready made, or your own recipe)

Instructions:
	Hard boil 1 egg. Set aside. (optional)
	Sort the lentils. Why sort? Dry lentils often have tiny stones in them. Depending on the brand, you may have fewer or no stones, but I always sort anyway. The agony of a chipped tooth is a lot worse than the effort of sorting lentils.
	Bring your 1.5 cups of broth to a boil. Toss in the regular lentils and the bay leaves. Bring back to a boil for a few minutes, then turn down to medium low. Depending on your altitude and stove, you may need to add more water to keep the lentils from boiling dry. Youâ€™re shooting for 20-30 minutes cook time on the lentils.
	Chop the onion, potatoes, and carrot.
	Toss the onions and carrots into a deep pan with some oil or butter. Cook on medium high until the onions start to get soft.
	Then toss in the potatoes, add about 1/2 cup water, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir then cover, cooking on medium for about 15 minutes. Stir to keep the potatoes from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add more water as needed. Cook on low for an additional 10 minutes or until the potatoes are soft.
	Preheat that oven of yours to 350F.
	When the potatoes are soft, slice the tomatoes. Set aside 4 slices, then dice the rest.
	Put the died tomatoes in with the potatoes for a few minutes until they soften.
	When the tomatoes and lentils are done, mix the lentils in with the potatoes, pull out the bay leaves and discard.
	Chop the eggs, then mix them in, adding the basil and oregano, the parmesan cheese (optional), and any additional salt and pepper to taste.
	Pour into your pie shell, then place the tomato slices on top.
	Cover the pie crust only with strips of aluminum foil to keep it from browning too quickly.
	Slide the pie into the oven and bake at 350F for about an hour.
